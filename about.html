                <P>
                     I am a junior developer, a hard worker, a father and a constant learner. My developer journey began officially in the spring
                    of 2017 with my purchase of Colt Steele’s “The Web Developer bootcamp” followed shortly by “The Ultimate Web Designer and
                    developer course" by Brad Hussey. Both of which I am still learning from every week. But my Developer learning was not limited
                    to these two courses. I’ve spent time peeling off into the frameworks, languages and libraries that I've come across in those
                    courses. This I believe has given me both an unorthodox and unique way of approaching web development. One in which my creativity can shine, goals
                    are always set, hard work is expected and learning never ends.
                </P>
                    <p>I am a father to a little girl. By far my greatest joy in life. 
                    She never misses a chance to tell me that i talk to myself and make weird faces at the computer when Im coding.
                    <br> I am a curious learner by heart. This is what drives and pushes me. No one thing can ever be learned too much. There is
                    always another lesson on the horizon and I eagerly look forward to it.

                   </P>

                    <p>My portfolio is growing. I have done some code alongs as well as two sites in Wordpress as of January 1,2019.
                        The jobs in Wordpress were done mainly with page editors also using some CSS and HTml and of course using my knowledge of both 
                        to make it easier. I created both Wordpres sites from start to finish in about 3 weeks. With little knowledge of Wordpress before hand.
                        Since then I have worked to expand my knowledge in Wordpress as well as the plugin that I used (Elementor)
